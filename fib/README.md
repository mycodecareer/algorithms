The Fibonacci sequence is an infinite series of numbers where each number is
the sum of the previous two numbers.

0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 ...

This is a great problem for practicing recursion.

Recursion however has a pretty terrible runtime, so it also gives a great
opportunity for looking at ways to improve that runtime.
